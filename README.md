All the codes I made for any purpose during my Bachelor's at TU Delft. This is the collection of all the codes I made(except for the ones that are forbidden to share).

The codes will mostly be in C++/Java, and if in any other language, then it's explicitly told to be made in that.

Feel free to use them as you like :)
